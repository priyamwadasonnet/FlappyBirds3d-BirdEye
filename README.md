Traditional 2D Flappy Bird gameplay often lacks depth perception, leading to
difficulty in accurately perceiving distances between the bird and obstacles. Leveraging the Scrum
methodology, our objective is to seamlessly integrate the 3D perspective while preserving the
addictive simplicity of the original game. Through iterative development cycles, we will adapt 2D
mechanics to a 3D environment, addressing design, user experience, and performance challenges. Our
goal is to revitalise the Flappy Bird experience, attracting a wider audience and rekindling interest in
the game. By utilising Scrum's adaptability and collaboration principles, we aim to optimise
performance and navigate the complexities of introducing a 3D perspective. This project contributes
to the evolution of mobile gaming by efficiently overcoming challenges and fostering renewed
engagement with the iconic Flappy Bird concept.
